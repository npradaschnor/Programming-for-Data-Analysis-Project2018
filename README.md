# Real World Problem Simulation Data Project2018

## Project 2018 - Programming for Data Analysis Module - HD Computer Science/Data Analytics at GMIT

In this repository a real world problem chose was obesity in women in Ireland. Four variables were created using the numpy.random function. The variables chose were: age, Body Mass Index (BMI), Daily Energy Intake and Waist-Hip Ratio (WHR). To generate those number a research was done and the mean/average of the variables found in the research was used. Mainly the project was based on results of the latest National Adult Nutrition Survey (NANS 2011), that is considered a major investment in providing food consumption data of the adult population in Ireland. 
After all the data was randomly generated, a histogram and a box plot were plotted for each variable. Besides, a function was used to check the peaks of the data. A data frame was created containing all the data and a pairplot was plotted.

You will find the project in the notebook file named 'Programming-for-Data-Analytics-Project2018.ipynb'.
