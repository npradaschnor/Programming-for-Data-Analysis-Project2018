# Real World Problem Simulation Data Project2018

## Project 2018 - Programming for Data Analysis Module - HD Computer Science/Data Analytics at GMIT

Considering my background in Nutrition and Food I've chosen **overweight/obesity** as **real world problem**. 

In my PhD and Master's I've worked with obese women in the waiting list for Bariatric Surgery. Therefore, I've chosen **adult women** residing in **Ireland** as my sample. 

Four variables were created using the **numpy.random** function. The variables chosen were: 
* age in years
* Body Mass Index (BMI) in kg/m2
* Daily Energy Intake in kcal
* Waist-Hip Ratio (WHR)

To generate those number a research was done and the mean/average of the variables found in the research was used. 

Mainly the project was based on results of the latest **National Adult Nutrition Survey (NANS 2011)**, that is considered a major investment in providing food consumption data of the adult population in Ireland. 

After all the data was randomly generated, a histogram and a box plot were plotted for each variable. A data frame was created containing all the data and a pairplot was plotted based on nutritional status (overweight/obese).
